# NIRA APP:
This application integrates eye-tracking and visual memory exercises to support individuals with visual memory and visual processing Disorder (VPD) in improving focus, attention continuity, and visual recall.
The app is designed to train the brain to initiate and sustain visual attention through real-time feedback, enabling users to strengthen cognitive skills needed for daily-life independence.

---
**1. Core Concept**
Sustained visual attention reinforces focus-related neural pathways. However, individuals with VPD often struggle to start focusing and maintain attention over time, especially with moving visual stimuli.
This app addresses that challenge by providing interactive, gaze-based feedback.

**2. Features**

***2.1 Eye-Tracking Focus Training:***
- A moving visual object (ball) controlled by gaze
- Object moves only if the user maintains focus for 300ms
- Movement stops immediately when focus is lost
- Trains attention **initiation and continuity**
- Encourages sustained visual engagement
  
***2.2 Visual Memory Training***
- Users observe images
- Follow-up questions test visual recall
- Designed to improve visual memory accuracy
- Targets one of the most common challenges in VPD
  
---
**3. Target Users**
- Individuals with Visual Processing Disorder (VPD)
- Users with visual attention or visual memory challenges

---

**4. App Statement**
Integrating eye-tracking features and visual-memory exercises to empower individuals with visual-memory issues to manage their daily lives independently.

---
**Tech Stack**
- Eye-tracking integration
- Visual memory assessment module
- Accessibility-oriented UI design
