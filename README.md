# NIRA APP (iOS)
NIRA is an iOS application that integrates eye-tracking and visual memory exercises to support individuals with Visual Processing Disorder (VPD).
The app helps users improve focus, sustained attention, and visual recall through real-time, gaze-based interaction and structured memory tasks.
Its goal is to strengthen cognitive skills that support daily-life independence.

---
## Overview

Individuals with VPD often experience difficulty initiating visual focus and maintaining attention over time—particularly when interacting with moving visual stimuli.
NIRA addresses this challenge by combining real-time eye-tracking feedback with visual memory training, allowing users to actively train attention continuity and recall skills.

## Features

**Eye-Tracking Focus Exercise:**
- Gaze-controlled moving object (ball)
- Object moves only after 300 ms of sustained focus
- Movement stops immediately when focus is lost
- Trains attention initiation and attention continuity
- Encourages sustained visual engagement through real-time feedback
  
**Visual Memory Exercise**
- Users observe visual images
- Follow-up questions assess visual recall
- Improves accuracy of visual memory
- Targets a core challenge associated with VPD
